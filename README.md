# Hello Web Project

## Introduction

- This is my first project for Makers Module 4 - Web Applications
- It is based on a Makers Flask web & database starter project, so it contains quite a lot of example code.

## Aims

I used this project to:
[x] Learn how to set up a Flask project
[x] Learn how to build routes
[x] Learn how to test-drive routes
